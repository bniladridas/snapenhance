          <h2 className="text-lg font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Google's Trust Framework</h2>

          <p>
            As a startup leveraging Google's AI technologies, we've spent considerable time thinking about how Google evaluates
            and ultimately trusts the applications that integrate with their services. This isn't just about meeting minimum
            requirements—it's about aligning with Google's vision for how AI should be implemented in the real world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on our experience building SnapEnhance and working with Google's Gemini API, we've identified several key
            factors that we believe influence how Google evaluates startups and their systems.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Technical Implementation Excellence</h2>

          <p>
            Google places high value on proper technical implementation. This goes beyond simply making API calls correctly—it's
            about implementing services in ways that are efficient, secure, and aligned with best practices.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-medium mt-6 mb-2">1. Direct API Integration</h3>

          <p>
            Our decision to use direct REST API calls instead of the JavaScript SDK for Gemini image generation demonstrates
            our technical competence and willingness to find the optimal solution rather than just the easiest one. This approach
            shows:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Problem-solving ability:</strong> We identified issues with the SDK for experimental features and found a more reliable alternative</li>
            <li><strong>Technical depth:</strong> We understand the underlying API structure well enough to implement direct calls</li>
            <li><strong>Commitment to quality:</strong> We prioritized a working solution over convenience</li>
          </ul>

          <pre className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md overflow-x-auto text-xs border border-border/30 shadow-sm">
{`// Example of our direct API implementation
const endpoint = \`https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/\${model}:generateContent?key=\${apiKey}\`;

const apiResponse = await fetch(endpoint, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(requestPayload)
});`}
          </pre>

          <h3 className="text-base font-medium mt-6 mb-2">2. Proper Error Handling</h3>

          <p>
            Google values applications that handle errors gracefully. Our implementation includes:
          </p>

          <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-border/30 shadow-sm">
              <h4 className="text-sm font-medium mb-2">Fallback Mechanisms</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                We implement multiple fallback strategies when API calls don't return expected results, ensuring users always
                have a good experience even when services are temporarily unavailable.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-border/30 shadow-sm">
              <h4 className="text-sm font-medium mb-2">Informative Error Messages</h4>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                When issues occur, we provide clear, actionable information to users rather than generic error messages,
                helping them understand what happened and what they can do about it.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3 className="text-base font-medium mt-6 mb-2">3. Efficient Resource Usage</h3>

          <p>
            Google appreciates applications that use their resources efficiently. SnapEnhance demonstrates this through:

            <li><strong>Optimized prompts:</strong> We craft efficient prompts that generate high-quality results without unnecessary token usage</li>
            <li><strong>Caching strategies:</strong> We implement appropriate caching to avoid redundant API calls</li>
            <li><strong>Rate limiting:</strong> Our application respects API rate limits and implements proper throttling</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-medium mt-8 mb-4">User Experience and Value Creation</h2>

          <p>
            Google evaluates applications not just on technical implementation but on the value they create for users.

            <li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> The application works well across devices, as documented in our mobile responsiveness blog</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Ethical Considerations and Responsible AI</h2>

          <p>
            Perhaps most importantly, Google evaluates how startups approach ethical considerations around AI. SnapEnhance
            demonstrates commitment to responsible AI in several ways:
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-medium mt-6 mb-2">1. Privacy and Data Protection</h3>

          <p>
            We've implemented strong privacy protections:

            By implementing Google's technologies properly, creating genuine value for users, and maintaining strong ethical
            standards, we believe we've created a foundation for long-term trust. This approach not only helps us maintain a
            positive relationship with Google but also ensures we're building a product that truly benefits our users.
          </p>

          <p>
            As we continue to grow and evolve, these principles will remain at the core of how we develop and enhance our
            platform. We believe that by maintaining this system-level approach to trust, we can build lasting relationships
            with both our users and the technology platforms we rely on.
          </p>

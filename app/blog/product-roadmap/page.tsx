            At SnapEnhance, we believe in transparencyâ€”not just about where we are today, but where we're headed tomorrow.
            This product roadmap outlines our vision for the future of SnapEnhance as we continue to evolve from a screenshot

          <h2 className="text-lg font-medium mt-8 mb-4">The Massive Truth About Our Vision</h2>

          <p>
            The massive truth that drives our product development is simple yet profound: <strong>visual communication is
            becoming the universal language of the digital age</strong>. As this shift accelerates, the gap between
            professional designers and everyday communicators must narrow. Our mission is to bridge this gap by democratizing
            access to professional-quality visual content creation while respecting the craft and expertise of design professionals.
          </p>

          <p>
            With this truth as our foundation, our roadmap focuses on three core pillars:

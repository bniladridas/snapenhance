            At SnapEnhance, we believe that a clear, consistent versioning system is essential for both our development team and our users. 
            Our version numbering system provides insight into the nature and significance of each update, helping users understand what 
            to expect when they see a new version announcement. This blog post explains our approach to semantic versioning and how to 
            interpret our version numbers.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-medium mt-8 mb-4">The Basics of Semantic Versioning</h2>

          <p>
            SnapEnhance follows the principles of semantic versioning (SemVer), a widely adopted versioning system in software development. 
            Our version numbers follow the format:
          </p>

          <div className="my-6 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg border border-border/50 shadow-sm text-center">
            <p className="text-lg font-medium">MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</p>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">Example: v1.3.4</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Each component of the version number has a specific meaning:
          </p>

          <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-6">
            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-border/30 shadow-sm">

                Incremented for significant platform evolutions that may introduce incompatible changes or represent fundamental shifts in the platform's capabilities or architecture.

            </div>

            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-border/30 shadow-sm">

              <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
                Incremented when new features or significant enhancements are added in a backward-compatible manner. Each minor version represents a meaningful expansion of capabilities.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-border/30 shadow-sm">

          <h2 className="text-lg font-medium mt-8 mb-4">SnapEnhance AI Version History</h2>

          <p>
            Our version history for SnapEnhance AI illustrates how we apply these principles in practice. Here's a breakdown of our recent versions:
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Major Version: v1.x.x</h3>

          <p>
            The current major version (v1) represents the first generation of SnapEnhance AI. This encompasses our core platform built on 
            Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek R1 models. A future increment to v2.0.0 would indicate a fundamental reimagining of the platform 
            or a significant architectural change.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Minor Versions: v1.0.0 to v1.3.x</h3>

          <div className="my-6 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg border border-border/50 shadow-sm">

            <h4 className="text-sm font-medium mb-2">Special Case: Version Number Gaps</h4>
            <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
              You may notice occasional gaps in our version sequence (such as between v1.2.3 and v1.2.5). These occur when we prepare 
              a version for release but identify issues during final testing that require immediate attention. Rather than renumbering 
              all subsequent release candidates, we increment the patch version and proceed with the release once the issues are resolved. 
              This approach maintains the integrity of our build and release process while ensuring only stable, tested versions reach our users.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-medium mt-8 mb-4">The Massive Truth About Version Numbers</h2>

          <p>
            The massive truth about version numbers is that they're more than just labels—they're a communication tool that connects 
            our development process with our users' experience. A well-structured versioning system provides transparency about the 
            pace and direction of development, helps users understand the significance of each update, and creates a shared language 
            for discussing the evolution of the platform.
          </p>

          <p>
            At SnapEnhance, we're committed to maintaining this clear, consistent approach to versioning as we continue to develop 
            and enhance our AI platform. By following these principles, we ensure that our version numbers provide meaningful 
            information about the changes and improvements in each release.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-medium mt-8 mb-4">Looking Forward: v1.4.0 and Beyond</h2>

          <p>
            As we continue to develop SnapEnhance AI, you can expect our version numbers to reflect the nature and significance of 
            each update. Our upcoming v1.4.0 release will introduce new capabilities that expand the platform's functionality in 
            meaningful ways, while subsequent patch releases (v1.4.1, v1.4.2, etc.) will refine and enhance these features.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're excited about the future of SnapEnhance AI and look forward to sharing our progress through our versioning system. 
            By understanding our approach to version numbering, you'll be better equipped to interpret each new release announcement 
            and appreciate the continuous evolution of our platform.
